GO :

-> create a file name called "app.go"
-> .go extension of the file
-> start coding on the file 
    ex:
    package main
    import "fmt"
    func main(){
        fmt.Print("Hello world");
    }

after creating  file run the file 

>> app.go

if you want to build go file need to crate module\

>> go mod init jithu.dev/first-app

>> go build 

it will create a file called "first-app.exe"
if you want to run the first-app.exe file 

>> .\first-app.exe

it will give you a Output the Result of the first-app.exe
